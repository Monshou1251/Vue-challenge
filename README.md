## Project Overview

The idea behind this app is to create a challenge for junior hackers to learn about web security vulnerabilities. It demonstrates common security issues according to the OWASP Top 10:

1. **Broken Access Control (A01:2021)**: The app showcases scenarios where access control is not properly implemented, leading to unauthorized access to restricted resources.

2. **Insecure Design (A04:2021)**: It highlights cases where the application's design and architecture introduce vulnerabilities that can be exploited.

The project aims to educate users about these security risks and how to mitigate them. Feel free to explore and learn from the provided challenges.

Happy hacking and stay safe!
